### Branching Strategy

- `main` represents truth
- branch naming convention: `<ticketNumber>-<summary-title>`

### Hosted instances

We currently have two instances available for preview:

- [UltraViolet staging instance](https://stagewebapp1.dlib.nyu.edu/) (requires VPN)
- 

## Continuous Integration (CI)

We currently have two main CI pipelines:

- CI:test for Ultraviolet (workflows/test.yml)
- CI for building Ultraviolet's docs (will be deprecated once we move documentation away from Jekyll + Github Pages)

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Go to our [Deployment docs](./DEPLOY.md)
